# SFFD-calls-for-service

For this project, we implemented a linear regression model for the prediction of the response time* in San Francisco's Fire Department's calls for service. This model was implemented on its online version as we are dealing with *big data* that is being updated daily. 

*Response time is the time in seconds elapsed from the moment the call is answered at the 911 dispatch center to the moment the dispatched unit acknowledges the dispatch and records that it is in route to the location of the call.

Additionally, as part of the data exploration process, we also carried out a clustering using k-modes algorithm from klaR package.
